- 👋 Hello! My name is Raf, an up and coming software developer who's really into well crafted designs, looking out for our communities, and ensuring everyone's voice is heard. 
      I have a background in Science (graduated as a Zoologist back in 2018), so my experience with code was very much on the data analysis side. I'm graduating this Spring
      from a Software Development program, and am looking forward to using the skills I've picked up on both my professional and personal life. 
      
- 👀 Currently, I'm interested in building websites, particularly small business sites. Although many people use sites like Instagram and Twitter to get their work out there, 
      these sites are by no means a great way to catalog work or make sales. I have a few friends that have echoed this grievance, and I hope that through what I have learned these 
      past couple of years I can help bridge merchants and potential curstomers. 

- 🌱 I'm currently learning React to further build on the JavaScript basis I got from my classes. It's been a fun experience so far, and really enjoy how reusable components are.

- 💞️ Community driven projects truly are my passion, knowing that my work is helping build a better place for those around me is often all the drive I need. Particularly, projects 
      helping raise and protect LGBTQ+ youth are incredibly important to me, and am always looking for ways to contribute. 

- 📫 You can reach me via email at rafaelgarciaoporto@gmail.com or on Twitter @oporto_garcia. I also have a LinkedIn if you wish to see a little more about my experience and education,
      and is also a good way to reach me.
